# TOP Node.js Course Project - Basic Site

06/02/2022 ~ 06/02/2022

## Objectives

Using Node.js, create a simple site that routes to the following:

- index.html when localhost:8080/ is visited
- about.html when localhost:8080/about is visited
- contact-me.html when localhost:8080/contact is visited
- 404.html whenever a page that is not defined is visited

## Learnings

Seems like there's quite a few ways to set up routing. Curious about the best practices for it. I ended up using a switch statement and it follows a logic that is similar to how react-routing works.
